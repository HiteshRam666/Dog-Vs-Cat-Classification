# 🐾 Dog vs. Cat Image Classification

Welcome to the **Dog vs. Cat Image Classification** project! In this project, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either a dog 🐕 or a cat 🐈.

## 📜 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. This is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and deep learning, often used as a beginner-level project for learning image classification.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of dogs and cats. The data is split into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-vs-cat-classification.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd dog-vs-cat-classification
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open `Dog_vs_Cat.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to see the code and run the cells interactively.

## 📊 Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers. This design helps the model to learn and extract features from the images effectively. The architecture also includes dense layers for classification.

## 🔍 Evaluation

The model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics on both the training and validation sets. Visualizations of the training process and the model's predictions are provided to better understand its performance.

## 📈 Results

The model achieves a good accuracy on the validation set, demonstrating its ability to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. For detailed results, check out the evaluation section in the Jupyter Notebook.

## 🎨 Visualizations

The notebook includes several visualizations to help understand the data and model performance:

- Sample images from the dataset
- Training and validation accuracy/loss curves
- Confusion matrix to visualize classification performance
